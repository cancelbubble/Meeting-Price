IE8 and below use Google Chrome Frame for the webkit animation goodness.  Currently do not have access to IE9 + so unsure of the experience.  Will need to test/update this when I do have IE9 +.

Unsure how <= IE8 work without Chrome Frame.  This is just a **personal project** I did at home on the Mac.  I'm tired of the bullshit IE virtual image time bombs using VirtualBox so this was developed/tested under Mac Firefox 6, Chrome 13, Safari 5 only.

PERSONAL TODOs:
----------------------
Add media query support for responsive design (mobile won't get the crap you could have bought).  Perhaps use branching singleton to get screen size, then conditionally execute (an immediate thought at time of this writing).

Add localStorage support to store $ for repeat visitors

only up to 1k in crap you could have bought
increment $500 up to 10k to cover broader all day meetings

Provide jQuery version, perhaps even other libs I've not used so I can play around in those.  Wanted to start out with core JS because it's so damn easy to forget some of that when you're stuck in jQuery land all day :)
